# V2X--Encryption
Toward Future-Proof V2X Security: A Comparative Evaluation of Pre- and Post-Quantum Encryption Protocols

Abstract—As Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication be-
comes a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle systems. ensuring
the security and scalability of vehicular networks. This pa-
per presents a comparative evaluation of five cryptographic
encryption schemes AES, RSA, ECC, Diffie–Hellman (DH),
and the post-quantum lattice-based algorithm focusing on their
suitability for real-time, resource-constrained V2X environments.
A simulation framework based on the VEREMI extension dataset
to assess each algorithm’s performance across key metrics,
including latency, throughput, CPU and memory usage aiming at
scalability, and resilience to adversarial conditions. Experimental
results show that while traditional schemes such as RSA and ECC
exhibit significant computational overhead, symmetric encryption
(AES) and the PQC achieved superior efficiency, leading in
both latency and throughput recording an average throughput
of 51,408.8 records/sec and a normalized throughput score of
1.0. DH demonstrated low CPU consumption but incurred the
highest latency, making it suitable for key exchange but less ideal
for continuous encryption. The evaluation further incorporates
a normalized scoring model, enabling a fair, multi-dimensional
comparison of algorithm performance. These findings underscore
the need for lightweight, quantum-resilient cryptographic solu-
tions to secure the future of V2X networks under both classical
and quantum threat models.
